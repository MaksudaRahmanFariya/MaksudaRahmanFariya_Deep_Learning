<h2>Explain Reinforcement Learning </h2>
<h3>Ans:</h3>
<p>Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</p>


<h2>Explain Biological Neural Network </h2>
<h3>Ans:</h3>
<p>A neural circuit is a population of neurons interconnected by synapses to carry out a specific function when activated. Neural circuits interconnect to one another to form large scale brain networks.</p>

<h2>Explain onvolution Layer </h2>
<h3>Ans:</h3>
<p>Convolution is the first layer to extract features from an input image. Convolution preserves the relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data. It is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs such as image matrix and a filter or kernel.CNNs compare images piece by piece. The pieces that it looks for are called features. By finding rough feature matches in roughly the same positions in two images, CNNs get a lot better at seeing similarity than whole-image matching schemes
Each feature is like a mini-image a small two-dimensional array of values. Features match common aspects of the images. In the case of X images, features consisting of diagonal lines and a crossing capture all the important characteristics of most X’s. These features will probably match up to the arms and center of any image of an X When presented with a new image, the CNN doesn’t know exactly where these features will match so it tries them everywhere, in every possible position. In calculating the match to a feature across the whole image, we make it a filter. The math we use to do this is called convolution, from which Convolutional Neural Networks take their name.</p>


<h3>Explain DNN </h3>
<h4>Ans:</h4>
<p>A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers. The DNN finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output, whether it be a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship. The network moves through the layers calculating the probability of each output.</p>

<h3>Concept of Backpropagation:</h3>
<p>Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. It is the method of fine-tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch . Proper tuning of the weights allows you to reduce error rates and to make the model reliable by increasing its generalization.
Backpropagation is a short form for “backward propagation of errors.” It is a standard method of training artificial neural networks. This method helps to calculate the gradient of a loss function with respects to all the weights in the network.</p>
